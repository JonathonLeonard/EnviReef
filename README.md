# Environmental Simulation Modelling

Lecture notes of the Environmental Science master unit [ENVI5809](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/units-of-study/2021/envi/envi5809.html), taught to 2nd semester students at the University of Sydney.

This lecture is tailored for a semester-long class, but these notes might also be of interest to other (envi-)scientists wanting to learn how to query, analyse and visualise scientific dataset. **Welcome to you all!**

## Usage

These notes are written as a companion to the lectures. During class, I will go through the major concepts and techniques for querying, analysing environmental datasets available from observing systems and models, and you can use these notes for independent learning. As a result most of the lectures and practicals will revolve around hands-on exercises and applications.

They are actualised on the go, as this course advances. I am trying to write them in such a way that they are understandable without actually *attending* the course, but I strongly recommend to participate to both the lectures and the practicals.

The notes are a mix of examples and small exercises for you to try. They are written in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io).
