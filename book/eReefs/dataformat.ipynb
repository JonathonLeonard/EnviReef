    "## Data Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Reefs data files are stored on centralised and backed up disk at AIMS, CSIRO and BOM. These data are accessable through a series of tools that allow external users to view, query, and retrieve the data via the internet and the world wide web.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "All of the data access methods for the eReefs data are centralised around **THREDDS** (*Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data Services*). **THREDDS** is middleware that bridges the gap between data providers and data users and consists of two main areas: \n",
    "+ the **THREDDS** Data Server (TDS) and \n",
    "+ the **Common Data Model (CDM)/netCDF-Java** library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**THREDDS** is developed and supported by Unidata, a division of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](http://www2.ucar.edu/)), and is sponsored by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### THREDDS Data Server\n",
    "\n",
    "The THREDDS Data Server (TDS) provides catalog, metadata, and data access services for scientific data. The TDS publishes [THREDDS catalogs](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/current/userguide/index.html) that advertise the datasets and services it makes available. These THREDDS catalogs are XML documents that list the datasets and the data access services available for the eReefs system. Catalogs may contain metadata to document details about the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TDS allows users to query the datasets listed in it's catalogs using several standard data access protocols. The available remote data access protocols for eReefs include OPeNDAP, OGC WCS, OGC WMS, ERDDAP, and HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TDS also supports several dataset collection services including some sophisticated dataset aggregation capabilities. This allows the TDS to aggregate a collection of datasets into a single virtual dataset, greatly simplifying user access to that data collection. For more information see the THREDDS Data Server page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Common Data Model (CDM) provides data access through the [netCDF-Java API](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/) to a variety of data formats (*e.g.*, netCDF, HDF, GRIB). Layered above the basic data access, the CDM uses the metadata contained in datasets to provide a higher-level interface to geoscience specific features of datasets, in particular, providing geolocation and data subsetting in coordinate space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OPeNDAP\n",
    "\n",
    "[OPeNDAP](http://www.opendap.org/) stands for \"Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol\". OPeNDAP is both the name of a non-profit organization and the commonly-used name of a data access protocol which the OPeNDAP organization developed. The OPeNDAP protocol provides a standardised means of requesting and providing data across the World Wide Web. The goal is to allow end users, whoever they may be, to access immediately whatever data they require in a form they can use, all while using applications they already possess and are familiar with. Ultimately, it is hoped, OPeNDAP will be a fundamental component of systems which provide machine-to-machine interoperability with semantic meaning in a highly distributed environment of heterogeneous datasets.\n",
